## Pull out cyp1a, ahr2, and b-actin genes only

Extracting cyp1a gene (3 probes) from raw and different background correction algorithms. Then I'll look at between array normalized data.

###Raw
```{r raw}
cyp1a.raw <- data.frame(a$E[a$genes$GeneName == "cyp1a"])
ahr2.raw <- a$E[which(a$genes$GeneName == "ahr2"),]
actb1.raw <- a$E[which(a$genes$GeneName == "actb1")]
```
